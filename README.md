# Spec-Checker

Update:
- Front-end development placed on hold while developing back-end using FireBase for easier API use.
- Front-end left basic in design, functionality is the current priority. Once application works
  as intended, then we will return to further develop the front-end to improve functionality (if needed)
  as well as overall aesthetic. 
  
Need-to-DO:
- Finish setting up API/database.
- Re-design search function to find game & associated info.
- Output searched results to user.

Future Ideas/Plans: 
- Utilize FireBase user authentication/profile system to email search results to the users emails.
- Update the design of the front-end to look more "video game-esque."
- Implement reset button to stay on main-page and search again if desired.
